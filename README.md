# Learn-Java
This is a repository used to teach Kylie Java
Assignment 1:
Complete each task with whatever organization method you think makes sense.

1. Demonstrate an understanding of GitHub. You should be able to fork this repository, clone the fork, create a develepment branch, commit a change, push a commit, merge a branch. The purpose of github is to enable to to collaborate with others. Practice these steps and you will later have an understanding of how powerful it is and how to use it.

2. Demostrate that you can create and run a Java "Hello World" program. Put the output in a .txt file and include it in your submission.

3. Demonstrate that you understand all Java Primative datatypes. Make at least one of each data type, print the data types value (using the data type!) Then print an explination of when you think you would use the data type. Bonus points: print how much memory each dataype uses. Here is one releveant resource, there are many online: https://www.javatpoint.com/java-data-types

4. Demonstrate that you understand several Java Non-primitive datatypes. Make at least one of each data type, print the data types value (using the data type!) Then print an explination of when you think you would use the data type. Print why you would use this datatype over a primative datatype. Analyze the pros and cons Bonus points: print how much memory each dataype uses. 

5. Demonstrate you understand how to call a method in java by printing a "Hello from method" from within your class.

6. Demonstrate you can get returns from methods by printing the result from a add function: "public int add(int a, int b)"

7. Demonstrate you can make your own object by utilizing multiple classes. Create a class called "Mathz" and move your add functions from into it. Instantate an object of this class called mathzWizard. Then use this objects by calling it's function add. 

From here on out you are encouraged to split your program up into the approprate classes. This is utilizing "object oriented programming"

8. Use if/else statements to solve the following: A system should print "The house is expensive" if price is over 250,000. The system should print "The House is expensive and big!" if the price is over 250,000 and the type is "large". The system should print "The house is cheap" if it's price is under 250,000. The system should print "The house is cheap and small" if the house is under 250,000 and type is "small". Finally, the system should also print "The house is red" if the color is red. 

9. Use a switch statement to print a random fact about an animal given it's species.

10. Create an infinite loop that prints out an explination of why it is infinite.

11. Create a for-loop that prints the numbers 1-100

12. Use the build in java utility for random numbers to print a random number from 0 - 2000.

13. Create a while loop that loops until a random number between 0 and 10 is equal to 5

14. Create a while loop that loops until an iterator is divisable by 50

15. Show that you understand what iterable in java is by using a "for each" loop to print it's contents.

16. Show that you can get input from a user and print it back out to a user.

17. Create a rudimentary word processor. This should have the following capabilities: Create a new text file. Allow the user to name the text file. Allow the user to make N copies of the file. Allow the user to edit the contents of a file. Display the character count of a given file. Display the word count (for simplicity, "a aaa a aaaaaaa" is considered 4 words) of a file. 


Assignment 2:

I will add this from your repo whenever you complete task 1. This will be the last time we use this repo. We will work out of your repo and you will have to add me as a collaborator.
